You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.

Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types. Embalmed Form: This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an alter self spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll. Enduring Dust: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed. Positive Energy Immunity: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands. Spell Immunity: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using spell immunity. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll.

Treat this as an <i>alter self</i> spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll. <br><i>Enduring Dust</i>: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed. <br><i>Positive Energy Immunity</i>: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands. <br><i>Spell Immunity</i>: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using <i>spell immunity</i>. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new <i>spell immunity</i> prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as greater <i>spell immunity</i>. Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp x the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.</h5><h5><b>Special: </b>You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, choose another ability granted by the feat.</h5></div>",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Jiang-shi,,,,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To use holy water in a particular way, you must meet the additional requirements of that effect, such as a particular feat, ranks in a specific skill, or the ability to cast a certain spell (specified after the effect's name). Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water. Blinding Water (Improved Precise Shot): By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Ref lex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don't rely on vision. Concentrate Holy Water (Craft [alchemy] 4 ranks): Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperpotent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks of holy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 x the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy). A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage x the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage x the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target. Healing Glyph (ability to cast glyph of warding): You can replace the diamond material component in a glyph of warding spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, you must place a spell glyph containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead. Healing Water (Heal 5 ranks): You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage. Holy Circle (ability to cast magic circle against evil): You can replace the silver material component of a magic circle against evil spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20. Holy Water Splash (Point-Blank Shot): When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase the damage dealt to creatures within the splash radius of holy water, such as the concentrate holy water ability of this feat or the empower holy water spell on page 26.",,,Undead Slayer's Handbook,"<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Holy Water Assault (Combat)</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5>You have found new and effective uses for holy water in combating the undead.<h5><b>Prerequisites: </b>Base attack bonus +1, Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks.</h5><h5><b>Benefit: </b>In addition to holy water's normal uses, you can use holy water to create a variety of other effects, which are listed below.

You can apply this insight to empower your magical effects.,"Int 13, Spell Focus (divination), Spellcraft 3 ranks.",Spell Focus (divination),"Immediately before casting a spell, as a swift action, you can attempt to augment a spell's casting using Arithmancy. To do so, determine the digital root of the name of the spell you are casting. To find the digital root of a spell name, first assign a numerical value to each letter of the name, per the Letter Values table. Once you have a string of digits, sum them. If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root. Once you've translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at -1 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell's name when determining the spell's digital root, but they increase the spell's level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess. For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented fireball. First, he translates the spell name into numbers. Fireball translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of fireball is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [fireball's spell level] + 2 [fireball's digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the fireball this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round.

First, he translates the spell name into numbers. <i>Fireball</i> translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of <i>fireball</i> is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [<i>fireball</i>'s spell level] + 2 [<i>fireball</i>'s digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the <i>fireball</i> this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast <i>fireball</i> and perform another action, though he expends the spell.</h5></div>",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0,,Spellcraft 3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1627,Sacred Geometry,General,You can use your mathematical prowess to add metamagic effects to your spells without using a higher-level spell slot.,"Int 13, Knowledge (engineering) 2 ranks",,"When you take this feat, select two metamagic feats you do not yet have. When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the Core Rulebook); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability. When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell's effective spell level. Refer to the Prime Constants table to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot. For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the magic missile he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [magic missile's base level] = 4, so the spell's effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41. Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 x 6) + (4 - 3) x 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] x 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged magic missile takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants.

Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. For the duration of the spell, each summoned creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability scores of the drawn card's suits. If both cards are the same suit, each summoned creature gains a +6 bonus to that ability score instead. If either card's alignment is a true match for the summoned creatures' alignment, the duration of the spell is doubled, while drawing an opposite match halves the duration of the spell. If both a true match and an opposite match are drawn, the spell's duration is unchanged. A creature summoned in this way is distinctly altered by the cards drawn.

Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]) . Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions. When the spells to be commixed are cast, one is designated as the primary spell (typically the higherlevel spell), while the other is the secondary spell. The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells' descriptors. Targeted creatures can attempt a saving throw against the primary spell as normal (assuming that a save is normally allowed), and then attempt a separate save against the secondary effect. The secondary effect's save type is described in its listing, and its save DC is equal to the normal save DC of the primary or secondary spell, whichever is lower (or, if neither spell allows a saving throw, 10 + lowest spell's level + spellcaster's primary spellcasting ability score [Int, Wis, or Cha] modifier). Commixed spells cannot be counterspelled normally. A creature with Improved Counterspell can counterspell commixed spells if both spells are correctly identified and both belong to the same school. Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled. Spell resistance still applies to the secondary effect, unless both of the commixed spells bypass spell resistance. Synergistic Benefits: The primary spell's save DC (if any) increases by 1. If either spell is normally modified by Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus, the bonus to save DCs granted by those feats stacks with this increase. The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance. Secondary Effects: While the secondary spell has no direct effect other than bolstering the effects of the primary spell, the combination of spells also creates a unique secondary effect depending on the elemental descriptors of the commixed spells. For the purpose of this secondary effect, the acid, cold, and electricity descriptors count as earth, water, and air descriptors, respectively.
